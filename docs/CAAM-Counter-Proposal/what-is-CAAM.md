# What is CAAM?

On Wednesday May 28th, 2025 the Faculty of Art held a visioning session about a new program called *Contemporary Art and Media* (CAAM), a proposal to close and combine four existing programs: Photography, Integrated Media, Printmaking & Publications, and Sculpture & Installation. The Letter of Intent, which has yet to be released publicly and was provided to the Students Union under confidentiality, states that this merger would streamline these programs in response to financial pressures, by reducing administrative duplication and offering more flexible, multidisciplinary learning. However, after a quick read, it wasn’t clear how the university planned to maintain program structures and still create “efficiencies” without cutting courses or increasing class sizes. 

For a lot of students, this proposal came out of nowhere, and it raised more questions than it answered. Program chairs were only notified late Friday afternoon to reach out to students for the session happening the following Wednesday. This effectively meant most students only found out about this two days before the session and had to scramble to make time to be there. Worse yet, the Student’s Union only found out the day before the visioning session, and thanks to the tireless work of the Campaigns and Advocacy Director, Ines Tang, along with Photography students Saif Boraei and Arpit Nigam (that’s me\!), the SU was able to investigate, prepare, and show up for the session in force. At the time there was also resistance from the administration to allow participation by Ines, as they are an Illustration major, even though the proposed changes would impact hundreds of the students they’ve been elected to represent. Ultimately, they yielded, allowing Ines to be present after mentioning that OCAD U’s by-laws allow student representatives to be present and involved in these kinds of forums. 

With such little notice and information available to students, the vision session which the Faculty of Art intended to gather student thoughts and ideas quickly became a question and answer session. The administration did not provide basic answers to questions directly when asked about the LOI, and stated they didn’t have a copy of the LOI on hand. Ultimately, the CAAM proposal didn’t address student concerns, namely the rising cost of tuition for international students, class sizes, clear explanations for what the program would functionally look like, how each program could maintain course offerings, and how such disparate programs could be merged together effectively. It also didn’t address faculty concerns about the rising number of seats available, limited paid hours and increasing general workload. 

It was also unclear what changes would be happening to the affected programs specifically, and how combining them would save the university money. Many students were left wondering, especially since programs would lose their individual identities, and we would be left having to explain what a degree in “Contemporary Arts and Media” is to employers. The Faculty still hasn’t provided a clear explanation for what actual changes would happen under their proposal, even after outlining that the LOI has been in development for over a year, with “considerable” amounts of student consultation. Many students voiced their frustration about the lack of answers, to the point that the FoA has dropped the CAAM branding, rebranding as a more generic “new program proposal”. 

After the CAAM Visioning Session concluded, students began to discuss the many ways that the original proposal could be improved. Shepherded by Saif, Arpit and Ines, the Students Union Campaigns and Advocacy committee began work on a program proposal which looked to address some of the shortcomings of the CAAM program. We focused on the needs of each program, and the ways in which they do or don't intersect.  We consulted with students, Peer Mentors, and volunteers from across the university, and began developing an alternative that could meet the university’s financial goals while actually supporting students and their work.

This new proposal merges programs according to existing similarities and relationships in industry. Photography and Integrated Media, for instance, already share overlapping workflows and practices, from lens-based work to time-based media. Combining these two programs would strengthen access to studios, expand thesis support, and preserve the depth of each program. Similarly, Sculpture & Installation becomes a specialization within Material Art & Design, giving students better access to facilities while maintaining their focus on material and media-based practices.

Instead of collapsing everything into one umbrella, our approach focuses on specialization through strategic partnerships. We view this as a fantastic opportunity to address the existing concerns that students have with access to studios and equipment, for example; Integrated Media has long expressed frustration about the lack of a dedicated Thesis pathway, and it’s fairly normal for students in Photography to incorporate time-based media (audio, video, etc.) in their projects. Combining INTM and Photo benefits both, especially as both the Photo Center and the Integrated Media Center often work together when acquiring equipment, sometimes duplicating existing capabilities. 

There are so many ways that we want to elevate student voices and concerns. While CAAM may have started off on the wrong foot, it is well within the realm of possibility that it could become a great example of how collaborative approaches to program restructuring can be good.

We believe students deserve to be part of shaping their education. This alternative proposal is about protecting what makes OCAD’s programs strong while being open to thoughtful, consultative change. We are not resisting change; instead, we want to make better, more informed change. In the words of Simon Glass, chair of Sculpture and Installation, “change is coming”, and we either create the change we want to see or allow change to be done to us. 

We are inviting feedback from students, faculty, and staff. This is not just our proposal. It is a collective one, and we hope it is a step toward making institutional change feel possible, transparent, and student-driven.
