# Introduction

*![](/assets/images/CAAM-Flow-Chart.png)*

On March 6th 2025, the Faculty of Art Dean proposed a new BFA (Bachelor of Fine Arts) program called Contemporary Art and Media (CAAM). This program seeks to combine four existing programs—Integrated Media (INTM), Photography (PHOT), Printmaking & Publications (PRPB), and Sculpture & Installation (SCIN)—into a single program that aims to fill the growing demand for versatile art practices, and provide foundational skills and knowledge in the contemporary art world. The program, proposed to take effect starting in September 2028, would eliminate and replace the existing programs, but aims to maintain the curriculum.

The program was first introduced to students and faculty via a "visioning session,” where Dean Stephen Foster outlined the significant financial challenges currently facing OCAD and Ontario’s post-secondary sector, citing tuition freezes, declining funding,  increased operational costs and less reliance on international students. Many universities have already begun suspending, closing or restructuring their Fine Art programs, amongst others. The Ontario government appointed auditors to OCAD starting June 2025, with the goal of identifying any perceived “inefficiencies” in OCAD’s administrative and academic programs, which could lead to program closures. The CAAM proposal was created as a potential solution by combining the existing programs into a more streamlined structure to  reduce administrative duplication and adopt cost-efficient deliveries such as large-enrollment courses and hybrid learning models. 

The CAAM Alternate Proposal was created to suggest potential solutions to streamline programs other than the proposed CAAM idea. Many students question the reasoning and viability of CAAM, and while the program is still in its infancy, many aspects are vague or unconfirmed. We agree that there are critical issues that must be solved before the Ontario government forces change on us, but we think CAAM fails to appropriately address them. Students wonder if CAAM’s promise to maintain program identities and course offerings while achieving financial savings is possible and realistic, and fear their program’s identity will be lost. There has been a lack of meaningful consultation with students and faculty in CAAM’s creation, increasing these concerns. The student community feels their voices have been overlooked in a process that profoundly impacts their education and future.

In response to the concerns, a new proposal was written. Our goal is simple: to resolve the issues with the original proposal and create a plan which eliminates inefficiencies, reduces costs and improves outcomes for students. This plan acknowledges the love that we, as students, faculty, and administration, share for our institution and these programs, and allows each of these sectors to have input on meaningful change at OCAD U.

Here are the ideas suggested by the proposal:

## Merging Photography and Integrated Media:

Photography and Integrated Media both center on time-based and lens-based practices, making them a natural fit together. Students in these disciplines explore camera work, moving images, sound, installations, and hybrid forms. This combination aims to provide a strong and flexible education in media-based practices, support digital and analogue workflows, prep students for fine art and commercial domains, and maintain and enhance OCAD’s reputation in the media landscape. For students, we feel this merge recognizes the impact of losing programs, and utilizes this change to create new opportunities, such as expanded access to resources, and richer interdisciplinary collaboration. 

The merge would expand access to facilities from OCAD’s current offerings for both programs. Darkrooms, film labs and studios would be pooled amongst the students instead of run separately. Training for these facilities could be run in greater numbers to reduce overlap and increase savings. Photography students could learn and work in an expanded list of mediums, and Integrated Media students could have more access to camera-based training. This would also address the existing issue of the Integrated Media program not having a dedicated thesis, which leaves students feeling unsupported and struggling to find relevant guidance.

These changes could be enticing to new students interested in media, especially as other schools condense their offerings. The chance to specialize in one of the two programs while maintaining a more general option allows for growth and exploration, while preserving the core of both programs. This merge could ultimately align with the realities of contemporary media-making, and prepare students with creative and technical skills to succeed in the evolving arts and cultural industries.

## Merging Design Photography and Art Photography Departments (optional):

The current separation between the Faculty of Design’s photography stream and the Faculty of Art’s established Photography program creates unnecessary duplication and missed opportunities. A single administrative structure simplifies scheduling, advising, and student support services, while better leveraging resources. It would allow for a more consistent curriculum, and educate from both art and design perspectives. Design students would have much greater access to facilities, such as darkrooms and studios, and pooling equipment could allow it to be managed more efficiently. Art students could have access to the more technical training offered by the Faculty of Design. Many Design students already take photography courses for personal interest or to strengthen their practices, meaning this change could be highly beneficial to them. Merging the departments would strengthen OCAD’s media offerings, and more a more rounded technical and artistic approach would strengthen student skills, better preparing them for professional work. Overall, this would create positive change for both the Faculty of Art and the Faculty of Design.

## Sculpture & Installation and Material Arts & Design:

Sculpture and Installation and Material Arts and Design both work with fabrication and materials, providing an area of overlap for combining the two programs. Students in these programs explore space, hybrid forms, and materiality, and use media like wood, plastic and metal to do this. Combining these programs aims to provide a flexible education in material-based practices, supports access to crucial facilities, prep students for fine art and commercial domains, and strengthens OCAD’s reputation in the material art landscape. For students, we feel this merge honours the programs, and utilizes change to create new opportunities.

We propose repositioning SCIN as a specialization within Material Art & Design, with two distinct streams: Material-based Sculpture and Installation and Media-Based Sculpture and Installation. The material-based stream would be delivered alongside the MAAD studio paths, and allow access to specialized shop facilities such as wood, metal, plastics and ceramics, increasing opportunities for technical training. The media-based stream would be delivered through the Integrated Media and Photography program in the Faculty of Art, allowing for appropriate access to facilities and equipment for media-based work. 

Students from either stream would gain critical access to facilities, and resolve the current issue of lack of registration priority for fabrication courses. Without access and training to these facilities, students cannot access them on their own time, hindering their artistic exploration. The new structure would encourage interdisciplinary learning, allowing for more fabrication credits to apply to their degree. MAAD studios would be used for more mediums, making the most of existing facilities and simplifying resource use and reducing waste. Broader material options mean students can better strategically select media to meet creative and budget goals. Scheduling inefficiencies will be identified and eliminated to maximize access. 

The proposed specializations would draw prospective student who value experimentation, while still allowing them to specialize if they wish. This change gives crucial resources to students, while preserving the core of both programs and encouraging rich interdisciplinary collaboration. This merge would ultimately align with the realities of contemporary art-and-material-making, and give students competitive creative and technical skills for work in the evolving artistic and cultural industries.

## Printmaking & Publications and Material Arts & Design (Option 1):

Printmaking and Publications has historically been rooted in interdisciplinary material practices, using textiles, ceramics, jewelry and bookmaking. This forms a relationship with Material Art and Design, where similar media are also used to explore materiality and forms. This combination aims to provide a strong and flexible education in material and print-based practices, prep students for fine art and commercial domains, and maintain and enhance OCAD’s reputation. We feel this merge recognizes the historical contexts of both programs, and utilizes this change to create new opportunities, such as expanded access to resources, and richer interdisciplinary collaboration.

As a specialization of MAAD, printmaking students could screen print on fabric, letterpress with cast metal, or digital printing with hand-bound forms, all things that have been very limited due to facility and course access. Students would gain access to both MAAD’s studios and equipment, and PRPB’s printing studios,  enabling them to create works that exist between print, craft, and object. Students would critically engage with the politics of reproduction, tactility, and form, which are particularly relevant in the age of mass automation. Shared critiques, studios and projects, allowing for richer interdisciplinary collaboration. The merge addresses the existing issue of the Printmaking and Publications not having a dedicated thesis, which leaves students feeling unsupported and struggling to find relevant guidance. The thesis would preserve the FA and BDes options of the MAAD program, adding a new pathway for PRPB students who wish to pursue a BDes degree.

This merge reflects how students are already working: fluidly, experimentally, and across mediums. Uniting the students and facilities under one program with a specialization allows for growth and exploration while eliminating duplication, creating long-term efficiencies and solving structural deficits. This provides students with the tools to succeed in an ever-changing art and design climate.

## Printmaking & Publications and Graphic Design, Illustration (Option 2):

Printmaking & Publications and design focused programs such as Graphic Design and Illustration all work graphically with printed materials, and use both design and art principles to engage wide audiences. This solution proposes that the current Printmaking and Publications program would merge into the existing design-focused programs. This combination aims to provide a strong and flexible education in graphic design, communication and publication fields. We feel this merge appropriately addresses the struggles of current Printmaking and Publications students, and provides additional benefits to students from the Faculty of Design.

Integrating Printmaking and Publications into existing design-focused programs offers several key benefits for students of both programs. Printmaking students would gain access to more technical training and increased course sections. Graphic Design & Illustration students would gain greater access to printmaking facilities, and as many students in Design already minor in Printmaking & Publications to boost their skills in printing, self-publishing and publications, the merge is a welcomed fit. Increased collaboration between design and art would lead to more community and interdisciplinary practices.

Embedding print media skills within Illustration and Graphic Design curricula bridges the gap between artistic experimentation and commercial application, preparing students for diverse careers in publishing, design, and media production. Ultimately, the merge offers students the opportunity to develop a comprehensive skill set that bridges artistic expression and professional application. This approach not only enhances learning opportunities but also strengthens community and resource sharing, positioning students for success in a competitive and rapidly changing creative landscape.

## Conclusion:

Overall, we feel these new options provide significant benefits over the proposed CAAM program, and solve many inefficiencies and overlaps. We believe this would lead to great financial savings, and ultimately allow for studio access and programming to continue in a time of financial hardship for Ontario post-secondary institutions. This proposal highly aligns with OCAD U’s Academic and Strategic Plan, as well as with OCAD U CO’s Seven Strategic Considerations, ensuring an appropriate fit in the institution. Finally, this proposal was made possible with meaningful consultation of students and faculty of all disciplines, and is inclusive to many perspectives and visions of what OCAD U can be. We hope the future of OCAD U is bright.
